# Real time Face Mask Detection
ML Classwork Project

The project aims at developing a solution in the current time of pandemic going on in the world.

Masks are one of the most important protection and preventive measures a person must take to be safe from COVID-19.

A system is proposed using state-of-the-art architectures MobileNetV2 and ResNet10 to detect faces from images and real-time video stream and detect masks on faces. It uses transfer learning to train models for 1.4 million iterations over 2.4 million parameters.

The final accuracy of the model is 95% with an f1 score of 0.95.

Project GUI was also developed and deployed on the Streamlit platform. It works on both mobile and desktop devices.
